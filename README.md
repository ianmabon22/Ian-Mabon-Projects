California Wildfires Damage Prediction Models
- Created 4 types of classification models to predict fire damage to structures affected by wildfires in California using physical building characteristics as predictors.
- Used the CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) Dataset which included 160,000 rows and also recent data from the devastating Palisades Fires.
- Concluded that roof construction and year built were important predictors for fire damage based on the dataset. 

NBA Betting Models
- Final project for my Data Analytics for Sports class where I took 17 years of NBA game data and sportsbook betting data and found relevant statistics such as how often favored teams won, how many times the 13 sportsbooks set the spread lines incorrectly, and the average point loss for those favored teams that lost.
- I then created decision tree classifiers that used a game's win/loss outcome as the target variable and only odds and spread as predictors to answer the question: "Can odds reliably predict game outcomes?"
- Concluded that odds are reliable predictors for game outcomes, but they are not perfect.

Salmon Population Model 
- Assigment for Programming for Analytics class using a salmon population dataset regarding the population change over time in the North West states of the US.
- After creating visulizations of relationships between columns in the data, I created a simple regression model to predict the population change in the future. 
- I then created a brief presentation to my findings for the professor and the class.

Data Mining Assignment 
- Tasked  with exploring a housing data set by creating visualizations and finding correlated variables and handling them accordingly.
- Created a model using forward, backward, and stepwise regression to find the best fit. 
- However, a simple model was deemed the best since the selections generated models with high RMSE.

Big Data and Analytics Project
- Used R Studio to perform graphical analysis of a European email correspondence dataset.
- Found metrics such as shortest paths, betweeness centrality, and density.
- Also created graphs and visualizations for interpretability. 

Analytics for Sports Assignment
- I was tasked to create a team strength model using game data from the WNBA.
- Created visualizations indicating team strength based on the league average and against the Washington Mystics. 
- Predictions were made for that season's playoffs.

Writing Samples
- Blog posts and executive summary created during my Marketing, Research, and Proposal Internship.
