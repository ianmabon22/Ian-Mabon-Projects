Salmon Population Model: 
- This is an assignment from my Programming for Analytics class where I found a salmon population dataset regarding the population change over time in the North West states of the US.
- After creating visulizations of relationships between columns in the data, I created a simple regression model to predict the population change in the future. 
- I then created a brief presentation to my findings for the professor and the class.

Data Mining Assignment: 
- This assignment tasked me with exploring a housing data set by creating visualizations and finding correlated variables and handling them accordingly.
- I then created a model using forward, backward, and stepwise regression to find the best fit. 
- However, a simple model was deemed the best since the selections generated models with high RMSE.
