This is an assignment from my Programming for Analytics class where I found a salmon population dataset regarding the population change over time in the North West states of the US.
After creating visulizations of relationships between columns in the data, I created a simple regression model to predict the population change in the future. 
I then created a brief presentation to my findings for the professor and the class.
